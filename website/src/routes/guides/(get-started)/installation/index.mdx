# Installation

You can add me to your project with a single command via your favorite package manager. Below is the command for npm.

```bash
npm install valibot
```

After that you can import me into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { â€¦ } from 'valibot';

// With a single import
import * as v from 'valibot';
```

> If bundle size is important to you, you should check if your bundler can still split the code if you use a single import.
